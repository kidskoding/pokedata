# CLAUDE.md — Project Context

## What this project is

Pokemon data science project focused on practicing UIUC Datathon competition
skills. All analysis lives in Jupyter notebooks — no separate Python packages.

## Tech stack

- **Python 3.13** managed by pyenv
- **uv** for dependency management (not pip)
- **Jupyter notebooks** for all work
- **pokebase** for PokéAPI data fetching
- Key libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn,
  xgboost, statsmodels, nltk, scipy, tqdm

## Commands

- `uv sync` — install/update dependencies into .venv/
- `uv run jupyter notebook` — launch Jupyter
- `uv add <package>` — add a new dependency

## Project structure

- `notebooks/` — 9 datathon skill notebooks (00-08), run sequentially
- `notebooks/00_data_pipeline.ipynb` — must run first, produces the dataset
- `samples/` — working reference notebooks (type visualizer, sprite saver)
- `data/` — gitignored, regenerated by notebook 00
- `outputs/` — gitignored, regenerated by notebooks
- `notebooks/archived/` — old notebook stubs from previous project structure

## Key conventions

- No src/ package — all code is inline in notebooks
- Constants (TYPE_COLORS, paths, etc.) defined in notebooks that need them
- Each notebook maps to a datathon skill (see STRUCTURE.md for mapping)
- Data pipeline: notebook 00 fetches from PokéAPI → saves CSV → other notebooks read CSV
- Pokemon-to-business domain mapping used throughout (Pokemon = customers, stats = behavior, types = segments, generations = time periods)

## Data

- ~1025 Pokemon from PokéAPI (Generations 1-9)
- Raw data: `data/raw/pokemon_raw.csv`, `data/raw/flavor_text.csv`
- Processed data: `data/processed/pokemon_clean.csv`
- All data files are gitignored and regenerated by running notebook 00
