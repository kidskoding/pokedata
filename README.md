# pokedata

data science, engineering, and analytics with pokemon in Python!

Using Pokemon data as a training ground to practice the full spectrum of data
science skills needed for UIUC Datathon competitions — from data cleaning and
EDA through classification, regression, clustering, NLP, time series, and
presentation storytelling.

## Notebooks

| # | Notebook | Datathon Skill | Real-World Analog |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 00 | Data Pipeline | Acquisition & feature engineering | First hour of any datathon |
| 01 | EDA & Profiling | Exploratory analysis | Understanding the dataset |
| 02 | Classification | Binary + multiclass | Credit risk (2025), churn |
| 03 | Regression | Predictive modeling | Spending forecast (2025) |
| 04 | Clustering | Unsupervised segmentation | Customer segments, risk tiers |
| 05 | Time Series | Trend analysis | Stock prediction (2019) |
| 06 | NLP | Text analytics | Chatbot satisfaction (2023) |
| 07 | Model Comparison | Evaluation & selection | Justifying choices to judges |
| 08 | Storytelling | Presentation & recs | Winning the competition |

## Quick Start

```bash
uv sync                      # install dependencies
uv run jupyter notebook      # launch jupyter
# run 00_data_pipeline.ipynb first, then any other notebook
```

## Project Structure

See [STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md) for the full directory layout, execution order,
and Pokemon-to-business domain mapping.

## Task Checklist
