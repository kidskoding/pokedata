# pokedata

data science, engineering, and analytics with pokemon in Python!

Practice the full spectrum of data science, engineering, and analytics skills
using Pokemon data — from ETL and SQL through predictive modeling, NLP, time
series, hypothesis testing, and presentation storytelling. These skills carry
directly to datathon competitions and real-world data work.

## Quick Start

```bash
uv sync                      # install dependencies
uv run jupyter notebook      # launch jupyter
# run 00_data_pipeline.ipynb first, then any other notebook
```
